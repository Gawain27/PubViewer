        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Publication Hub was born out of the need to bridge the gaps between authors, their publications,
            and the journals or conferences they have participated in. The aim is to provide a centralized
            platform to uncover correlations, foster collaboration, and evaluate academic contributions
            effectively.
